    "# How to Use Background Subtraction Methods {#tutorial_background_subtraction}\n",
    "=========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Background subtraction (BS) is a common and widely used technique for generating a foreground\n",
    "    mask (namely, a binary image containing the pixels belonging to moving objects in the scene) by\n",
    "    using static cameras.\n",
    "-   As the name suggests, BS calculates the foreground mask performing a subtraction between the\n",
    "    current frame and a background model, containing the static part of the scene or, more in\n",
    "    general, everything that can be considered as background given the characteristics of the\n",
    "    observed scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![](images/Background_Subtraction_Tutorial_Scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Background modeling consists of two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -#  Background Initialization;\n",
    "    -#  Background Update.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the first step, an initial model of the background is computed, while in the second step that\n",
    "    model is updated in order to adapt to possible changes in the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this tutorial we will learn how to perform BS by using OpenCV. As input, we will use data\n",
    "    coming from the publicly available data set [Background Models Challenge\n",
